<h3>In the Beginning ...</h3>

<img src="Images/GermanShephard3.jpg" alt="German Shepherd" width="130" height="160" class="thumbnailleft">

<p>Rent A Pet began with a family that loved dogs.  George Smith and his wife Carol owned two German Shepherds.  These dogs were pets to the Smith family children and extended family members.  One day as George was walking his dogs in the park, he noticed how they attracted the attention of passing women.  They seemed to like to stop what they were doing and ask him about his dogs.  A young woman remarked that she would love to have a big dog like that to walk, but she had a small apartment and couldn't keep a large dog.  This brief encounter was the beginning of an idea.  What if there were others, possible many others, who wanted companionship of pets without the responsibility?  Maybe people would be willing to pay to rent or borrow a pet for a short period of time.



</p>

<p>George shared his idea with Carol and they began to look at the pros and cons related to start a small business that would rent dogs for a day. <br>

<p>After weighing these points, the Smiths decided to go ahead by starting small and in the fall of 1980 started Rent a Pet.  The business offered its customers the companionship of a pet without all the care of the extra expense or hassles of ownership.  They began with only providing dogs for rent.  Since the company's inception, Rent a Pet has extended their offerings by also adding cats, horses, pigs and snakes for rent.
